# Steps

1. [Fork][] the repo.
2. Add a breaking test for your change.
3. Make the tests pass.
4. Push your fork.
5. Submit a pull request.

# Code Style

Running the tests using `rake` (with no args) will also check for style issues in the code. Ideally all submissions would pass these checks. If the code style is causing issues (particularly the method or class size) we can work with you to correct it. Don't let it stop you from contributing.
