# Contributing

Bug fixes and optimizations are welcome.
For optimizations please provide some reproducable proof of the improvement.

For features please open a [discussion][] and we can make sure the feature fits with the gem before working on it.

## Steps

1. [Fork][] the repo.
2. Add a breaking test for your change.
3. Make the tests pass.
4. Push your fork.
5. Submit a pull request against the `next` branch.

## Code Style

Running the tests using `rake` (with no args) will also check for style issues in the code. Ideally all submissions would pass these checks. If the code style is causing issues (particularly the method or class size) we can work with you to correct it. Don't let it stop you from contributing.
